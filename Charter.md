# Juno Charter Proposal

### Executive Summary

This Charter, presented here by the Juno Working Group, proposes to reorganize the Juno Commonwealth’s operational structures for a limited trial period and formalize policies and processes to foster collaboration, transparency, accountability, and community involvement in the Commonwealth’s operations. 

In particular, it proposes to dissolve and/or transition Juno’s current subDAOs into new Departments and to federate those Departments under a Council (see Glossary below), all with the Juno Commonwealth as their administrator. 

Under this Charter, Departments must implement open meeting practices and collaborate through the Council in order to develop and present unified operating budgets to the Commonwealth for approval, among other tasks. 

The Commonwealth will have a veto right over all Council proposals and ultimate and full control over Departments’ Treasuries and membership.

This document is comprised of this Executive Summary, The Juno Commonwealth Charter detailing the rules and policies of the new structure, The Charter Implementation describing the steps and actions to be taken in implementing this Charter, and a Glossary of terms.

This document has been prepared and submitted for review by:

- Brady (Signal DAO)
- Jacob (Atlas DAO)
- Lil D (Neta DAO)
- Jake (Core-1)
- Ray Raspberry (Y Foundry)
- Dimi (Core-1)

The Charter introduces two new structures: the Council and Departments.

The Council is a subDAO comprised of Departments.

A Department is a subDAO that:

    a) has the Juno Commonwealth as its administrator, and 
    b) is appointed by the Juno Commonwealth to the Council.

The Juno Commonwealth will have veto power over the Council when the time-lock and veto feature is supported by DAO DAO.


## III. Juno Commonwealth

Under this Charter, the Juno Commonwealth remains the main organ for decision-making on Commonwealth governance issues.

In addition to its usual role as arbiter of governance issues, the Commonwealth is assigned additional rights and responsibilities by this Charter, including:

    a) appointing and dissolving Departments,
    b) appointing and dissociating Department Members,
    c) vetoing Council proposals (when technically possible on-chain),
    d) revoking funds from Departments, and
    e) determining compensation for Department Delegates to the Council
    f) extending, modifying, or canceling this Charter

    
## IV. The Council

The Council is a federated administrative and operational body comprised of Departments. At the most general level, the Council is a place for deliberation and collaboration among Departments concerning their respective focus areas and the Commonwealth’s overall needs and ambitions. 

### Section IV.1 — Authority and Responsibilities

The Council’s authority and responsibilities include:

    a) allowing for community oversight of operational decision-making processes 
       through the hosting of public meetings,
    b) submitting unified quarterly budget requests to the Commonwealth 
       from the Departments,
    c) allocating and suspending funding to Departments,
    d) developing and implementing a Request for Proposal policy 
       to be used by Departments,
    e) providing a forum for Departments to collaborate on Juno’s operational needs,
    f) ensuring mutual oversight on all Departments’ activities,
    g) establishing, maintaining, and publishing public meeting schedules, 
       meeting attendance logs, and minutes.

### Section IV.2 — Open Meetings
The Council must host a standing open meeting at least once per month.

The appointed Representative or an appointed Alternate from each Department must be in attendance for the Council to be permitted to conduct any business.

### Section IV.3 — Decisions and Actions
Every Council decision and action (see Glossary below) must be introduced at a public meeting, subjected to a Council vote, and subsequently executed through the DAO DAO platform.

### Section IV.4 — Voting
Each Department is allotted a voting seat on the Council.

### Section IV.5 — Vote Period
Council proposals must allow a minimum open voting period of five (5) days. 

When DAO DAO includes time-lock functionality, a ten (10) day time-lock period will be applied to Council proposals, creating a fifteen (15) day period before a proposal can be executed.

### Section IV.6 — Quorum
Quorum is established when an absolute majority of Departments is present or has voted.

### Section IV.7 — Passing Threshold
An absolute majority constitutes the passing threshold for a Council proposal.

### Section IV.8 — Compensation

Department compensation for faithful service in carrying out the affairs of the Council is determined by the Juno Commonwealth and then tabulated and distributed by the Council.

Compensation tabulations for Departments will be conducted and presented on a monthly basis during Council standing meetings.

At the conclusion of each quarter (every three months), the Council will disburse retroactive compensation for the preceding three tabulation periods to all active Department treasuries from the Council treasury.

#### Compensation Eligibility 

Delegate compensation eligibility is assessed monthly. To be eligible for compensation inclusion, Delegates must meet these criteria during a tabulation period:

    a) participate by voting on every council proposal, and
    b) not benefit from Council, Department, or Commonwealth vesting contracts, and
    c) serve as an appointed Delegate for the entire tabulation period

Department members that benefit from Council, Department, or Juno Commonwealth managed vesting contracts are to be excluded from the Council's tabulation of Department compensation for serving as a Delegate.

## V. Departments

Departments are engaged in the day-to-day requirements of operating the chain and achieving the goals established through governance. Departments must 

### Section V.1 — Authority and Responsibilities

Each Department shall be responsible for:

    a) making decisions and executing actions within its subject area,
    b) creating and maintaining its own Operating Policy, including its Council and 
       Department consensus mechanism(s), hiring and dissociation policies, and any 
       other criteria pertinent to its operations,
    c) submitting a quarterly line-item budget for the Department to the Council,
    d) appointing a Representative (and Alternates) to the Council,
    e) voting on Council proposals,
    f) publicly soliciting, reviewing, and selecting and/or rejecting proposals (RPF)
        when seeking to budget for any department expense exceeding $5,000 USD
    g) establishing, maintaining, and publishing an open meeting schedule, 
       meeting attendance logs, and minutes.

### Section V.2 — Open Meetings
Each Department is required to host standing open meetings at least once per month.

### Section V.3 — subDAOs
Departments may create subDAOs within themselves for organizational or administrative purposes. These subDAOs confer no additional or independent membership or voting rights to the Council.

### Section V.4 — Identification
All members of a Department are required to utilize identifiable, human-readable names that are associated with their active social media accounts when performing official duties, including the use of DAO DAO.

### Section V.5 — Department Members
Members of a Department may be divided into broad categories of roles and responsibilities. 

Primary roles in each Department include, but are not limited to:
   
    a) Delegates:
        At least three (3) and up to five (5) members may be appointed to share the decision
        making authority of Department operations and its vote on the Council;
        each Delegate is assigned control over a portion of the Department vote on the 
        Council;
    b) Representative: 
        appointed by the Delegates, this position is responsible for attending and 
        representing the Department in any Council meetings or matters;
        Departments may assign up to TWO (2) alternate Representatives that will be
        recognized in order to engage in official business.
    c) Contributors: 
        members assigned day-to-day operational tasks or project work;
        Contributors may vote on internal Department affairs as determined by the 
        Department’s Operating Policy;

### Section V.6 --- Council Representation

Each Department must assign a Representative to engage in the affairs of the Council on behalf of the Department to ensure comprehensive participation and effective communication during the session.

Departments may also choose to declare up to two (2) alternate Representatives to engage in Council affairs on behalf of the Department. Alternates must be assigned their role using the same process as the Representative role and identified as "Alternate Representative" and, in the case of two (2) Alternates, "First Alternate Representative" and "Second Alternate Representative" to clarify the rank of the Representative. 

Duties of Representation are first assigned to the Representative, if they are not available or unable to fulfill the responsibilities then the First Alternate may represent the Department.  If the Representative and First Alternate are not available then the Second Alternate may represent the Department in Council business.

### Section V.7 --- Minimum Viable Membership
To be considered an active department, membership must include a minimum of three (3) members who have been elected to the Delegate role.

### Section V.8 -- Active Department Status
Departments failing to meet Minimum Viable Membership requirements [as defined by Section V.7] shall not be accorded active status, thereby rendering them ineligible to exercise voting privileges on Council matters. Nonetheless, they shall persist in contributing to the calculation of Council quorum.

### Section V.9 — Conflicts of Interest

Each Delegate must, upon their appointment, publicly submit a disclosure of any conflicts of interest to the entirety of the Council membership.

Delegates must maintain and keep current disclosures in the event of the emergence of new conflicts. In cases where a Delegate acknowledges a conflict of interest pertaining to a particular undertaking or subject matter, the delegate must recuse themselves from any deliberations or discussions concerning the matter. Additionally, the delegate must cast an 'Abstain' vote on any matters directly related to the identified conflict.

### Section V.10 — Recalls

The Juno Commonwealth may at any time recall and remove any Department member for any reason.

## VI. Open Meeting Policy

The Council and all Departments must adhere to generally accepted Open Meeting Law governance practices allowing for the use of Closed Sessions under the following circumstances:

    a) matters which may imperil public safety or network / chain security if disclosed;
    b) matters which may disclose the identity of a law enforcement agent or informer;
    c) information relating to current or future investigation or prosecution of a 
        criminal offense which would imperil effective law enforcement if disclosed;
    d) proposed, pending or current litigation;
    e) collective bargaining negotiations;
    f) personnel decisions or the medical, financial credit or employment history of a 
        particular person or corporation;
    g) the preparation, grading or administration of examinations; and
    h) real property transactions or the proposed acquisition of assets where publicity 
        would substantially affect the value.

## VII. Budget Policy

For a budget to be considered by the Council, any requested resource allocation must be clearly defined as a line-item and include the following:

    a) person(s) or organization to receive the allocation
    b) purpose of the allocation
    c) quantity of allocation and asset denomination
    d) duration of time with which the allocation will be used
    e) the selected RFPs, if the allocation of the line-item equals or exceeds $5000 USD

## VIII. Limited Trial Period

This Charter will be in effect for a limited trial period lasting two quarters (six months) or until a complete Constitution is ratified, whichever comes first. 

If a Constitution is not ratified by the end of the trial, the Council and the Juno Working Group (or an authorized subsidiary or replacement entity) may submit recommendations to the Commonwealth to extend, modify, or cancel this Charter in part or in full. 

## IX. Ratification and Amendment

This Charter will be ratified and amendable by standard Commonwealth vote.

# Glossary

* **Absolute Majority**: Also known as a simple majority, refers to a situation where more than half of the total votes or members in a group or assembly support a particular proposal, candidate, or decision. In other words, it signifies that over 50% of the votes or members are in favor, ensuring that the chosen option has the support of the majority.
* **Actions**: Actions refer to the specific steps or measures taken to implement a decision or policy. These are the practical and tangible activities that need to be carried out as a result of a decision. For example, if a governing body decides to allocate funds for a new project, the action might involve releasing the funds, hiring personnel, and initiating the project.
* **Council**: SubDAO consisting of Departments under the authority of the Juno Commonwealth
* **Decisions**: Decisions represent the choices or determinations made by a governing body after considering various options, proposals, or matters under consideration. Decisions can encompass a wide range of issues, from setting policies and budgets to approving projects or making strategic choices. Voting is often used to make decisions within a governing body, with the outcome being a choice that determines the course of action.
* **Department**: A SubDAO assigned as a member of the Council
* **Juno Commonwealth**: All Accounts staking $JUNO tokens through chain governance modules; also known as Juno Community DAO.
* **Open Meeting**: An open meeting is one which is accessible by the Commonwealth and adheres to generally accepted open meeting policies as defined in Article VI of the Charter.
* **Request for Proposal (RFP)**: A request for proposal process is a public announcement to solicit bids related to a specific scope of work to be done for the Commonwealth. The purpose of a RFP process is to facilitate a fair, transparent, structured, and competitive procurement process for goods, services, or projects.

## Initial Council Compensation

Initial Department compensation is:

| Amount  | Denomination | Per | Per | Distributed | Terms |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|750 | $JUNO  | Delegate  | Month     | Quarterly | Retroactively |


###### **750 $JUNO per Delegate per complete month of service** 

Compensation is tabulated as total concurrent eligible* Delegates per Department.  Compensation is to be paid retroactively at the end of the quarter from the Council treasury to each active Department treasury with the amount of compensation being based on the past quarter (three months) of tabulations.

###### Compensation is to be paid directly to the Department Treasury, not directly to individual delegates.

For the initial quarter maximum possible $JUNO allocated to a Department for a full quarter term service is 11,250 $JUNO.  For a Department to receive the maximum possible allocation they would need to have five (5) Delegates each serving the complete three months (one quarter) with no Delegate ineligible due to benefiting from any Commonwealth vesting contract.

The maximum total distribution for the first 3 months would be 33,750 $JUNO, which will not likely be realized as multiple members of the initial departments are disqualified from being included in compensation tabulations.

The initial compensation was determined by discussion over the value of Juno goverance participation and including consideration for Kraken central exchange's 12-month time-weighted average USD price (TWAP) for $JUNO between $0.70 and $0.75 USD.

###### * A delegate's elegiblility for inclusion in compensation tabulations is defined by Section IV.8
---

## Initial Department and Council Membership

This Charter implementation primarily reorganizes Juno’s existing operations and existing subDAO contributors were allowed to determine their positions in the new structure featuring three (3) Deparments comprising the Council membership.

New members to the departments for the open slots will be confirmed and added via governance proposals for each member applying for a position.
