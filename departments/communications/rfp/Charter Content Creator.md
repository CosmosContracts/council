# Request for Proposal (RFP)
## Juno Communications Department - Charter Content Creator Role

### Project Overview
The Juno Communications Department invites proposals for a dedicated content creator or team focused on charter-related content. This role demands meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to accurately capturing and disseminating discussions and meetings related to the Juno Charter and its interactions with the Juno blockchain community.

### Scope of Work
The successful applicant(s) will be tasked with:


- **Video Snippets from Charter Meetings and Calls**: Capturing key moments and information from community calls to create engaging snippets for broader distribution. (1-2 minute videos)
- **Tracking and Reporting on Charter Discussions**: Collaborate closely with the Charter Administrator, who is responsible for managing the charter's administration. The content creator is to gather key points and discussions from the administrator regarding the charter's process. Using this information, the role involves creating and updating content across Juno's communication channels, including Twitter and written articles, to keep the community informed on the ongoing discussions and resolutions within the charter.
- **Uploading Meetings to Juno Spotify**: Edit and prepare recordings for upload to Juno’s official Spotify channel, ensuring accessibility to the community.
- **Recording Meetings**: Capture audio (and potentially video) of all meetings and twitter spaces appointed by the department such as council meetings and community calls.

**Responsiveness and Availability**:
*The candidate is expected to be actively responsive on a daily basis as communicative content production is time-sensitive.*

**Estimated Working Hours**:
*The estimated working hours for this role are 15-20 hours per week. The primary focus of these hours will be on content creation, including producing video snippets. Additional time is dedicated to transcribing and summarizing meetings to distill key points. These summaries are essential for drafting detailed Twitter threads and articles, which will then be reviewed by the writing specialist.*

**Video Snippet Production**:
*Each video snippet is expected to take approximately 3-4 hours to create. Given the time commitment and the need to maintain high-quality content, the candidate should plan to produce about two snippets per week.*
