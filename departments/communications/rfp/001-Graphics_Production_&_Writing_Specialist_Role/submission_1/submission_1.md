Hello Communications Team. You already know me by Dragonmonk111. I feel really aligned with this role, and believe that I can bring the zest and magic to help revive Juno back to its glory with my visual creativity and writing skills. I put my money where my mouth is and have been following every post and article from Juno since its inception. I have chosen Juno as my Interchain home and have no conflict of interest or association with any other chain.

GRAPHIC DESIGN 
Since this post was published, I have looked at various AI art generation tools and have produced a few images using Midjourney that I am attaching with this email. I have chosen an abstract cosmos background that represents the multitude of possibilities in which the Juno ecosystem can expand, and the Goddess Juno embracing all those possibilities with her arms wide open.

I have also created a graphic design using a free graphics design app, which I will also be attaching with this email. Though it is quite simple due to limitations of resources at my end, I plan to get a paid subscription of a more advanced app and work on it as the role demands. 

I have the experience of creating graphic content outside of Web3 and believe that I can do the same for Juno with my artistic flair and creativity.

WRITTEN CONTENT
Having studied at an ICSE school in India, reading works of Shakespeare and writing content for the school newsletter; I grew up being an invaluable asset to whichever unit I got posted to in the Army. I have been the Officer incharge of writing public psy-op content for an entire Command and editing content for my Commanding Officers.

I have read all medium articles written for Juno, including all tweets. I always wondered if I could proof-read some of that content as I often found some silly mistakes and grammatical errors in the articles. My life has revolved around Web3 and Juno since the last 2-3 years and I have a basic understanding of the Cosmos tech.

I have not written a dedicated web3 article or a thread as of yet, but I do look forward to it. 

I did write the minutes of the JUNO-ABSTRACT Discord stage meeting and posted on twitter as the event took place. The thread was liked by the Abstract account. I definitely could have written better though had I looked upon the notes rather than posting them live.

I also jotted down the JUNO-LANDSLIDE Discord stage meeting minutes in my notes and shared it with the Juno Discord Community. Attaching a screenshot of the same herewith.

I would also like to share that I am very passionate about Juno and its future. I am ready to burn the midnight oil to work on Juno and it would be a privilege to be a part of the Communications Department and the Charter.
