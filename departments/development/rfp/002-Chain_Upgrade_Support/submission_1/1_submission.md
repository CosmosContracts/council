### Rate:

-   Poroburu proposes a rate of $50 per hour for my services.

### Breakdown:

-   2 hours per week to read and study every issue, PR, and respective line of code committed to the [`CosmosContracts/juno`](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno) GitHub repository
-   -   To gain situational awareness of Juno Network development and maintenance
-   -   To propose testnet upgrades to testnet participants when Juno release candidates are published
-   -   As a value add to indirectly train a committed Juno community member on these chain development and maintenance skills
-   7 hours per month on call to facilitate:
-   -   Test and Production upgrade coordination for Juno Network
-   -   Create and iterate upon chain upgrade policy

### Maximum Budget:

-   Poroburu proposes a maximum monthly budget of $750 for the duration of the project.

### Flexibility

-   Poroburu is open to discussing adjustments to the pricing structure and budget allocation to accommodate any specific requirements or constraints identified by Juno Network.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### Response time to establish a chain upgrade plan. (for both planned and emergency upgrades)

-   Two weeks to draft initial chain upgrade plan and research Cosmos industry standards.
-   Two weeks to finalize chain upgrade plan through iterative correspondence.
-   In the event of a Juno chain upgrade before this chain upgrade plan is finalized, Poroburu will mirror the previous chain upgrade process.

### Response time regarding the necessary communication with the different stakeholders

-   Critical: up to 12 hours
-   Urgent: 24 hours
-   Scheduled: 3 days to 1 week

### Regular reporting schedule
