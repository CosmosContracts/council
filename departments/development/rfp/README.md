# Development Department RFPs

The purpose of this folder is to store all the RFP (Request for Proposals) that were initiated by the Development Department. Each RFP will have its own folder, where the RFP document will be stored, and as well all the documentation or records that the Departments or Council decids to keep because it is deemed as important for the RFP process.

## RFP folder naming convention

The folder that is created for each RFP should apply the following convention:

RFP _ < RFP_TITLE > _ < STATUS >

Example: "RFP_Chain Upgrade Support_Open"

- `RFP_TITLE`: short, clear and direct RFP title.
- `STATUS`: Current status of the RFP
  - **Open**: Every RFP that has been publicly released and for which the process has been initiated but not concluded.
  - **Closed**: RFP for which the process was initiated but is currently closed. This state does not indicate whether the RFP objectives were achieved successfully or not
