# Development Department RFPs

The purpose of this folder is to store all the RFPs (Requests for Proposals) initiated by the Development Department. Each RFP will have its own folder where the RFP document will be stored, along with any documentation or records that the Department or Council decides to retain because they are deemed important for the RFP process.

## RFP folder naming convention

Each RFP should be stored in a folder named with the following convention:

`[SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER]-[RFP_TITLE]`

Example: `001-Chain_Upgrade_Support`

- `SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER`: A unique number assigned to each RFP in sequential order, starting from 001.
- `RFP_TITLE`: short, clear and direct RFP title.

## RFP sub-folder document structure

Each RFP folder should contain the following sub-folders and files:

1. `proposal_request.md`: The RFP document that outlines the project overview, scope of work, proposal requirements, and submission guidelines.
2. `status.md`: The status document that tracks the progress of the RFP process, including proposal submission dates, review committee members, and proposal review summary.
3. `submission_[ X ]`: A folder will be created for each qualified submission. This folder will contain all proposals, revised proposals, counter proposals. Each document name starts with a number, that represents the order in which the documents were produced.
