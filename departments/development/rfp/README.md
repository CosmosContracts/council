# Development Department RFPs

The purpose of this folder is to store all the RFPs (Requests for Proposals) initiated by the Development Department. Each RFP will have its own folder where the RFP document will be stored, along with any documentation or records that the Department or Council decides to retain because they are deemed important for the RFP process.

## RFP folder naming convention

The folder created for each RFP should follow the convention below::

RFP-[RFP_TITLE]-[STATUS]

Example: "RFP-Chain Upgrade Support-Open"

- `RFP_TITLE`: short, clear and direct RFP title.
- `STATUS`: Current status of the RFP
  - **Open**: Every RFP that has been publicly released and for which the process has been initiated but not concluded.
  - **Closed**: RFP for which the process was initiated but is currently closed. This state does not indicate whether the RFP objectives were achieved successfully or not
