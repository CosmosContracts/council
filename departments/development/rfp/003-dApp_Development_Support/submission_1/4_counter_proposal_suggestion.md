Dear Juno Development Department,

Thank you for the counter-proposal and the opportunity to discuss the terms in more detail.

After reviewing the counter-proposal, we would like to suggest the following revisions:

1. Trial Period: We propose a 1-month trial period instead of the initially suggested 3 months.

2. Telegram Group: We have noticed that the Telegram group messages are highly populated. To ensure focused and efficient communication, we prefer to triage our discussions within a dedicated chat group focused on development matters.

We hope these modifications align with your expectations and help streamline our collaboration. Please let us know if these adjustments are acceptable or if there are any further discussions needed.

We look forward to your response and to commencing our collaboration.

Best regards,

Hasan
