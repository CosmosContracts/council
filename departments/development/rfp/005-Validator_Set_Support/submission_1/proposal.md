# Proposal for Juno Network Blockchain Support Role - Validator Set Support

## Overview

Poroburu is a validator operator in the Cosmos ecosystem.

Poroburu's relevant background and interests: Active Juno community member, DAO contributor, Bitcoiner, Cosmos and crypto ecosystem pundit.

## Qualifications and Relevant Experience

### Poroburu ([Github](https://github.com/poroburu), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/poroburu))

-   Operated validators for Poroburu and Neta DAO reliably for two years.

-   -   Poroburu: Passage, Nomic
-   Policymaker for Neta DAO and Juno Network
-   Contributed to Neta DAO, Juno, DAO DAO, 1337 Society, Horcrux

## Proposed Approach and Methodology

Poroburu proposes a trial period of two months to demonstrate my capabilities and compatibility with the project. This timeframe will allow both parties to assess the effectiveness of my collaboration and ensure that it aligns with the goals and expectations of all stakeholders involved.

**Note: Poroburu is flexible to discuss what needs to be done in accordance with the needs of Juno Network.**

### Rate:

-   Poroburu proposes a rate of $25 per hour for my services.

### Breakdown:

-   7 hours per week to provide validator support in the `#validator-lounge` and `#validator-private` Juno Network Discord channels
-   3 hours per week:
-   -   To research or escalate, novel or intensive, support issues
-   -   To update validator documentation as required on [docs.junonetwork.io](https://docs.junonetwork.io/)

### Maximum Budget:

-   Poroburu proposes a maximum monthly budget of $1000 for the duration of the project.

### Flexibility

-   Poroburu is open to discussing adjustments to the pricing structure and budget allocation to accommodate any specific requirements or constraints identified by Juno Network.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### Response time for addressing requests

-   Minimum: Instant to 1 hour
-   Off-peak: 4 hours
-   Maximum: 10 hours
-   Availability: 7 days a week

Notes:

-   This SLA for support is 100% async, off-peak is when I'm not at my workstation, and maximum is to facilitate rest.
-   It will take approximately 16.67 hours to reach 20,000 blocks if each block is created every 3 seconds.
-   This maximum response time allows validators a minimum possible window of 6.67 hours to receive support and attempt to not be slashed for downtime.
-   Juno's slashing parameters can be found here: [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/parameters) [ping.pub](https://ping.pub/juno/params)

### Availability for the responsibilities regarding documentation.

-   24 hours for minor edits and corrections as required when documentation is found to be lacking while serving validator support requests
-   3 days for requested new documentation or to stage updated documentation after chain upgrade proposal is up to vote

### Regular reporting schedule

-   Monthly report on Validator Set Support rendered including:
-   -   Count of support requests
-   -   Documentation work log
-   Weekly as required:
-   -   Analysis of support request clusters that reveal Juno Validator Set systemic issues to be brought to the attention of the Juno Development Department
-   Instant:
-   -   Critical vulnerabilities presented in the `#validator-private` Juno Network Discord channel
