# Proposal for Juno Network Blockchain dApp Development Support

## Note: For this RFP process, candidates had to send their submission via a google form. The information below was taken directly from the form submission.

### NAME:

Reece

### DESCRIPTION:

This is a legit response. $34,500 USD per month in noble USDC for scope of work outlines. net 30 day payment terms assumed to be recurring until canceled by either party at the end of the next billed month. This budget may include a secondary hire out of the per month budget to assist in development and maintenance. By default it is 2 developers. Part of this also include no public comments by me regarding Juno, or the secondary hire. Entirely behind the scenes in stealth.

1. My work experience: https://work.reece.sh/
2. It's general maintenance, work log speaks for my abilities & possible a second hire within the scoped budget above
3. - Security patches handled within 3- 5 days excluding holidays. Following standard testnet & mainnet procedures put in place.

- Module maintenance for security issues and cleanup depends on the scope of work needed, which the development department / governance would need to submit on a per use cases basis. Depending on complexity, this would go above and beyond standard rates, feature dependent.
- SDK v47 -> v50 migration quote is $37,900 not included in the standard per month maintenance above. This would include the codebase to SDK v50 / CometBFT 38 with ABCI++, module migrations, staking high severity security patches (currently affects Juno in SDK v47 GHSA-86h5-xcpx-cfqc), end-to-end testing, testnet, and mainnet validations.
- Increase CI for validation for additional future code.

4. Using standard market rates for 2 & 1 possible part time + a reasonable profit margin after tax.
5. reference 1 for worklog.

Further support for automation and developer tooling like native integration with local-interchain in the main codebase will be added to increase developer UX.

Availability for maintenance and upgrades is high availability with full time to full time + part time work output depending on the 2ndary hire. Bi-Weekly reporting on completed maintenance, cleanup, security, and features worked on / improved. Including current pending work such as Core-1 vesting accounts being canceled (i.e. Lobo).

FYI Juno is not a POA chain as the RFP suggest. Unless Juno is switching to my module for that and a permissioned system. Seems odd and out of place but if you want it, sure requires SDK v50.

Further, if Juno want's native price fees with Skip's slinky, SDK v50 is required so the chain can build native DeFi applications using the trusted data secured by Juno's validators and not outside 3rd parties (i.e.e OjO from Umee).
