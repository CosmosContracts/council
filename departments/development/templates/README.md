# Development Department Templates

Here we can store templates to be used within known processes, like:
- Correspondence (emails, notifications) with RFP applicants, submitters to our department form, or contributors in general;
- RFP document structure;
- Recurring on-chain proposals' text;
- Anything that's implied by our policies & precedures.
