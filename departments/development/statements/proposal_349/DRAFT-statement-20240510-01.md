## Re: Juno Commonwealth Proposal #349: Signal proposal for the council to put dapps as the first priority
#### May 10th, 2024

The Juno Charter Development Department recommends rejecting Juno Proposal #349.

The Development Department acknowledges the critical role that decentralized applications (dApps) play in the growth and vitality of the Juno ecosystem.

The Development Department stands behind the current efforts to implement and adhere to a Request for Proposal (RFP) structure as outlined in the Juno Charter.

Relevant Charter RFPs in progress:

* dApp Support role, by the Development Department
* Blockchain Maintenance Engineer, by the Development Department
* Community DEX, by the Operations Department
* Content Creation roles, by the Communications Department

These Charter RFP initiatives are designed to facilitate transparent decision-making, accountability in execution, foster collaboration among the Juno Community, and set expectations for elected Charter Delegates and the providers of procured services. 

While Juno Proposal #349 highlights the need for dApp development, the Development Department believes the Charter's RFP structure is better positioned to bootstrap a dApp ecosystem that the Juno Commonwealth deserves.

The Development Department invites Juno Commonwealth proposal authors to engage with the us for further discussion and feedback on how to align their proposed initiatives with the Charter's principles and current Department initiatives. Correspondence can be directed to `dev.dept@juno.zone`, and we commit to providing a thoughtful response within two weeks.
