## [Juno Network Proposal #349](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/349)
### May 10th, 2024

The Juno Commonwealth Development Department respectfully recommends rejecting Juno Proposal #349, emphasizing the importance of aligning proposed initiatives in a collaborative and good faith with ongoing efforts being carried out by the Development Department.

We acknowledge the critical role that decentralized applications (dApps) play in the growth and vitality of the Juno ecosystem. However, we advocate for a strategic approach that upholds the principles of accountability and transparency outlined in the Juno Commonwealth Charter.

The Juno Development Department stands behind the current efforts to implement and adhere to Request for Proposals (RFPs) as outlined by the Council which have been implemented in the Community DEX request created by Operations Department and dApp Support role developed by Development Department. These initiatives are designed to ensure inclusive decision-making processes and foster collaboration among the Juno Community and accountability to the elected Delegates.

While Juno Proposal #349 highlights the need for dApp development, we believe that our department's ongoing efforts are better positioned to address this objective within the framework of the Charter. Our commitment to accountability and transparency guides our actions as we work towards executing the shared goals of the Juno Commonwealth in a sustainable way.

We invite proponents of Proposal #349 to engage with the Development Department for further discussion and feedback on how to align proposed initiatives with the Charter's principles. Correspondence can be directed to dev.dept@juno.zone, and we commit to providing response within two weeks.
