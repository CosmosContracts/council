## Re: Juno Commonwealth Proposal #349: Signal proposal for the council to put dapps as the first priority
#### May 10th, 2024

To Whom It May Concern,

The Juno Development Department respectfully recommends rejecting Juno Proposal #349.

We acknowledge the critical role that decentralized applications (dApps) play in the growth and vitality of the Juno ecosystem. However, we advocate for clearly defined and strategic approach to be carried out in collaboration with the ongoing efforts of the Development Department.

The Juno Development Department stands behind the current efforts to implement and adhere to a Request for Proposals (RFP) structure as outlined in the Charter.  

Current RFPs efforts underway are:

* Community DEX, created by Operations Department
* Blockchain Maintenance Engineer
* dApp Support role, as developed by Development Department
* Content Creation roles, by Communications Department

These RFP initiatives are designed to ensure inclusive decision-making processes and foster collaboration among the Juno Community and accountability in execution and results for the elected Delegates and the providers of the requested services.

While Juno Proposal #349 highlights the need for dApp development, we believe that our department's ongoing autonomous efforts are better positioned to address the objectives desired. 

We invite proponents of Proposal #349 to engage with the Development Department for further discussion and feedback on how to align their proposed initiatives with the Charter's principles and current Department activities. Correspondence can be directed to dev.dept@juno.zone, and we commit to providing a thoughtful response within two weeks.
