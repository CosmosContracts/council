   1. Time & Contribution Tracking [name=kopeboy] Tracking time is useful. To understand what is needed the work has to be done to understand it and tracked it. [name=Ray Raspberry] If the work falls outside of delegate work, it should be tracked and scoped to RFP (future) [name=poroburu] A lot of time spent is reviewing the work of others. [name=AndreGo] We work in a transparent way, anyone interested to know what each delegate is doing or producing has the ability to see the work being done. The advantage of tracking is for bounties and work to know time/hours and compensation
