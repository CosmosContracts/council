## New Business

1. Community Education - Chain Maintenance
  - Ray will organize first session with Dimi

1. ~~Q3 Budget~~
  - Already covered in Working Group Updates

1. Q1 Compensation
  - Funds issued from Q2 Budget will be used for Q1 delegate compensation

1. Council Meeting topic discussion
  - Poroburu: Core1 Vesting
    - every election delegates get a bonus
    - if community doesn't think the delegate is worth the bonus , they can elect someone else.
  - referencing Christiano = vesting is not a good way to compensate contributors
  - there is a degree of unsustainability in compensation via vesting
  - are people being compensated in dollars or are people being compensated in a share of the governance of Juno?  Ray: this is something that should be decided. 
  - **REFERENCE**: [Amendment F](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/council/blob/main/charter/DRAFT-F-DELEGATE_REMUNERATION.md)
  - Core1 Vesting Discussion:
    - The decision on Core1 vesting contracts is a decision for the community, not for the council.
  - Core1 was a failed state, with remnance that needs to be cleaned up
  - Poro would like to communicate with the community about the vesting contracts that they are believed not to be in the best interest of the community or the community is not receiving the best value
  - Vesting funds do not exist into the future.  We're not taking away funds, but instead stopping the future vesting of funds.
  - Funds already vested will not be touched.
  - Andre: Canceling core 1 is not just about saving money, but the message being sent and the community's perception of the council and the council's ability to make decisions in the best interest of the community.
