# Development Department Regular Meetings

The purpose of this folder is to store documentation associated with the Development Department `REGULAR_MEETINGS` activity. These include at least one document per meeting, that is generally structured like the following:

- Itemized Agenda
- Meeting Minutes

A template of this document can be found in this folder under the name `Juno Dev Dept Meeting Agenda & Minutes [TEMPLATE]`

These are public meetings happening every week on _Discord_ in the Juno Network server.

The current scheduling can be followed [here](https://discord.com/events/816256689078403103/1224865559632547942)

## Regular Meetings file naming convention

The file that is created for each Regular Meeting should apply the following convention:

< MEETING_NUMBER > \_ Agenda&Minutes \_ < DATE >

Example: "Agenda&Minutes_27-02-2024"

- `MEETING_NUMBER`: meeting number for order reference. The number should reflect the date order
- `DATE`: date of meeting in the format dd-mm-yyyy
