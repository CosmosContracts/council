The Charter introduces two new structures: the Council and Departments.

The Council is a subDAO comprised of Departments.

A Department is a subDAO that:

    a) has the Juno Commonwealth as its administrator, and 
    b) is appointed by the Juno Commonwealth to the Council.

The Juno Commonwealth will have veto power over the Council when the time-lock and veto feature is supported by DAO DAO.


## III. Juno Commonwealth

Under this Charter, the Juno Commonwealth remains the main organ for decision-making on Commonwealth governance issues.

In addition to its usual role as arbiter of governance issues, the Commonwealth is assigned additional rights and responsibilities by this Charter, including:

    a) appointing and dissolving Departments,
    b) appointing and dissociating Department Members,
    c) vetoing Council proposals (when technically possible on-chain),
    d) revoking funds from Departments, and
    e) determining compensation for Department Delegates to the Council
    f) extending, modifying, or canceling this Charter

    
## IV. The Council

The Council is a federated administrative and operational body comprised of Departments. At the most general level, the Council is a place for deliberation and collaboration among Departments concerning their respective focus areas and the Commonwealth’s overall needs and ambitions. 

### Section IV.1 — Authority and Responsibilities

The Council’s authority and responsibilities include:

    a) allowing for community oversight of operational decision-making processes 
       through the hosting of public meetings,
    b) submitting unified quarterly budget requests to the Commonwealth 
       from the Departments,
    c) allocating and suspending funding to Departments,
    d) developing and implementing a Request for Proposal policy 
       to be used by Departments,
    e) providing a forum for Departments to collaborate on Juno’s operational needs,
    f) ensuring mutual oversight on all Departments’ activities,
    g) establishing, maintaining, and publishing public meeting schedules, 
       meeting attendance logs, and minutes.

### Section IV.2 — Open Meetings
The Council must host a standing open meeting at least once per month.

The appointed Representative or an appointed Alternate from each Department must be in attendance for the Council to be permitted to conduct any business.

### Section IV.3 — Decisions and Actions
Every Council decision and action (see Glossary below) must be introduced at a public meeting, subjected to a Council vote, and subsequently executed through the DAO DAO platform.

### Section IV.4 — Voting
Each Department is allotted a voting seat on the Council.

### Section IV.5 — Vote Period
Council proposals must allow a minimum open voting period of five (5) days. 

When DAO DAO includes time-lock functionality, a ten (10) day time-lock period will be applied to Council proposals, creating a fifteen (15) day period before a proposal can be executed.

### Section IV.6 — Quorum
Quorum is established when an absolute majority of Departments is present or has voted.

### Section IV.7 — Passing Threshold
An absolute majority constitutes the passing threshold for a Council proposal.

### Section IV.8 — Compensation

Department compensation for faithful service in carrying out the affairs of the Council is determined by the Juno Commonwealth and then tabulated and distributed by the Council.

Compensation tabulations for Departments will be conducted and presented on a monthly basis during Council standing meetings.

At the conclusion of each quarter (every three months), the Council will disburse retroactive compensation for the preceding three tabulation periods to all active Department treasuries from the Council treasury.

#### Compensation Eligibility 

Delegate compensation eligibility is assessed monthly. To be eligible for compensation inclusion, Delegates must meet these criteria during a tabulation period:

    a) participate by voting on every council proposal, and
    b) not benefit from Council, Department, or Commonwealth vesting contracts, and
    c) serve as an appointed Delegate for the entire tabulation period

Department members that benefit from Council, Department, or Juno Commonwealth managed vesting contracts are to be excluded from the Council's tabulation of Department compensation for serving as a Delegate.

## V. Departments

Departments are engaged in the day-to-day requirements of operating the chain and achieving the goals established through governance. Departments must 

### Section V.1 — Authority and Responsibilities

       other criteria pertinent to its operations,

    d) appointing a Representative (and Alternates) to the Council,

        when seeking to budget for any department expense exceeding $5,000 USD

### Section V.2 — Open Meetings

Departments may create subDAOs within themselves for organizational or administrative purposes. These subDAOs confer no additional or independent membership or voting rights to the Council.

### Section V.4 — Identification
All members of a Department are required to utilize identifiable, human-readable names that are associated with their active social media accounts when performing official duties, including the use of DAO DAO.

### Section V.5 — Department Members
Members of a Department may be divided into broad categories of roles and responsibilities. 

Primary roles in each Department include, but are not limited to:
   
    a) Delegates:
        At least three (3) and up to five (5) members may be appointed to share the decision
        making authority of Department operations and its vote on the Council;

        Department’s Operating Policy;

### Section V.6 --- Council Representation

Each Department must assign a Representative to engage in the affairs of the Council on behalf of the Department to ensure comprehensive participation and effective communication during the session.

Departments may also choose to declare up to two (2) alternate Representatives to engage in Council affairs on behalf of the Department. Alternates must be assigned their role using the same process as the Representative role and identified as "Alternate Representative" and, in the case of two (2) Alternates, "First Alternate Representative" and "Second Alternate Representative" to clarify the rank of the Representative. 

Duties of Representation are first assigned to the Representative, if they are not available or unable to fulfill the responsibilities then the First Alternate may represent the Department.  If the Representative and First Alternate are not available then the Second Alternate may represent the Department in Council business.

### Section V.7 --- Minimum Viable Membership
To be considered an active department, membership must include a minimum of three (3) members who have been elected to the Delegate role.

### Section V.8 -- Active Department Status
Departments failing to meet Minimum Viable Membership requirements [as defined by Section V.7] shall not be accorded active status, thereby rendering them ineligible to exercise voting privileges on Council matters. Nonetheless, they shall persist in contributing to the calculation of Council quorum.

### Section V.9 — Conflicts of Interest

Each Delegate must, upon their appointment, publicly submit a disclosure of any conflicts of interest to the entirety of the Council membership.

Delegates must maintain and keep current disclosures in the event of the emergence of new conflicts. In cases where a Delegate acknowledges a conflict of interest pertaining to a particular undertaking or subject matter, the delegate must recuse themselves from any deliberations or discussions concerning the matter. Additionally, the delegate must cast an 'Abstain' vote on any matters directly related to the identified conflict.

### Section V.10 — Recalls

The Juno Commonwealth may at any time recall and remove any Department member for any reason.

## VI. Open Meeting Policy

    b) matters which may disclose the identity of a law enforcement agent or informer;
    c) information relating to current or future investigation or prosecution of a 
        criminal offense which would imperil effective law enforcement if disclosed;
    d) proposed, pending or current litigation;
    e) collective bargaining negotiations;
    f) personnel decisions or the medical, financial credit or employment history of a
