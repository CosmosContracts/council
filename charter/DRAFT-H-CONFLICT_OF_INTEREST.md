# AMENDMENT H: CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This policy should replace `Section V.9 â€” Conflicts of Interest` of the Juno Charter.

## Conflict Of Interest policy

1. Any Juno Council Department member should disclose immediately or as soon as it becomes relevant, if he has any potential Conflict Of Interest (COI), defined as:

    1. on-chain compensation from an entity surpassing compensation from the Council, its Departments & SubDAOs, on a monthly basis, excluding staking rewards;
    2. ownership or governance rights of an entity that is entering an agreement with, or receiving any funding, delegation or token from, the Department or its SubDAOs;
    3. direct or indirect control of at least 0.5% of the current total supply of an entity's native token whose trading volume is more than the compensation of all members.

2. Any proposal made by the member to his Department (or any of its SubDAOs) regarding such entities must note the proposer COI in its on-chain text.

3. The member with COI must vote ABSTAIN (or abstain from voting) on Department's (or any of its sub-DAOs') proposals regarding such entities; the member might participate in public discussions regarding such proposals only after remarking his COI. 

4. Members of the Council and its SubDAOs cannot accept gifts and won't individually claim, transfer or use unsolicited airdropped tokens in any way during their mandate.

### Methodology

5. COI as defined above should be disclosed by the subject member with an on-chain proposal to his Department, titled `Conflict Of Interest Disclosure` or `COI Disclosure update` and listing the ID or linked brand name of entities defined above for each month or for an indefinite period: in the latter case, the COI is valid until the member is removed or posts a new COI.

6. Compensations & trading volumes are compared at their single most exchanged pair or route over the last 28 days (UTC closings average price & total volume).

### Monitoring & Consequences

7. To allow "transparency agents" to report undisclosed COI and violations of this policy, the Council must provide a publicly-accessible & free-to-submit `COI Reporting` form:
    1. its submissions should be visible only to Council members (to avoid public defamation) for 28 days (during which public remedy actions might be taken), and to the public afterwards;
    2. the Council should set its URL as value of a `COI_Reporting` *storage item* on its DAO and link it on a publicly accessible & immutable content together with this policy.

8. To incentivise reporters and disincentivize violations, the Council must freeze its compensation to the subject member until relevant submissions are verified, and redirect it to the reporter with a proposal that, when passed, confirms the veridicity of the report.

9. When failing to comply with any of points 1 to 5 above, the member should be removed from the Council, Department and its SubDAOs and stop receiving related compensations.

### Unforeseen conflicts

10. This present policy tries to defend Juno community by prescribing duties for Council members, but it's important to remind that anyone may at anytime submit a Juno Governance Proposal directly to all JUNO stake-holders to report unforeseen conflicts, suggest remedies or improvements, veto or override Council's decisions in general.
