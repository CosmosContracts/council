# AMENDMENT D: ROLE OF DELEGATES

## D. Role and Scope of a Delegate (5-7)

### 5. RESPONSIBILITIES OF DELEGATES

    The main responsibility of elected delegates is representing the Juno community best interests through the lens of their own individual ethical principles.  This responsibility is fulfilled by maintaining and attending public meetings for their department, voting on Council and Department proposals, declaring conflicts of interest, presenting oneself as a respected steward of the Juno community assets and values.

    Delegates are responsible for recruiting and contracting appropriate and accountable parties other than themselves to complete department day-to-day tasks, and general chain operations.

### 6. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

    The purpose of the public department meetings is to give the community the opportunity to obtain information and provide feedback. A distinction is made between internal meetings which the public may attend and public meetings in which the public may participate and speak. At internal public meetings, the focus is on coordination between the delegates of a department, while providing community members the ability to observe, but not the right to participate. Weekly meetings are recommended, but only one per month is mandatory. In addition, this revision makes one further public “stage” meeting per month mandatory. “Stage” meetings are used for direct dialogue with community members and an allocated portion of the meeting for community engagement. (f.e. stage-meeting on Discord or Twitter space).

### 7. CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

    The delegates are primarily representatives of the community and are expected to contribute 10 hours per week on this activity. The daily work should be carried out by contributors with clearly defined scope and roles. The core task of the delegates is the publication of RFPs, the filling of contributor positions, as well as the management and control of their contributors.
