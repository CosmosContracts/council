# AMENDMENT F: DELEGATE REMUNERATION

## Delegate Remuneration Policies

### 1. REMUNERATION

    The delegates' remuneration is set at 600 USD per month and paid in JUNO tokens. The number of Juno tokens is determined by the 12-month time weighted average price on the first of the month in which the budget for the next quarter is submitted to the Council. The Operations Department is responsible to compile the individual budgets in the last month of a quarter.

    Changes to the compensation scheme can be decided by the Council, but only come into effect after the next two elections have been held.  As part of a strategic reorganization of the departments and tasks of the delegates, the remuneration scheme can also be changed at the beginning of the next quarter, but then requires a governance proposal and the approval of the community.

### 2. ATTENDANCE

    Any Delegate who does not attend at least 2 meetings per month of their department is ineligible for compensation. To count as an official department meeting a meeting has to be announced at least 72 hours in advance on Discord and entered into the events calendar. 

### 3. REPORTING

    At the end of each month, departments tabulate department delegate attendance and submit the results through the departmentâ€™s Council representative at the next Council meeting. It is the responsibility of the Operations Department to compile these lists and store them.

### 4. INDEMNIFICATION

    The Charter will indemnify its delegates as required and may indemnify others to cover legal costs incurred from work done on behalf of the network if wrongly arraigned. Indemnification payments are prioritized but will be managed to ensure the Juno network can meet other financial obligations.
