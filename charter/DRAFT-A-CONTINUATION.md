# AMENDMENT B: TERM OF OFFICE AND REMOVAL PROCESS

## B. Term of Office and Removal Process (2-3)

### 2. TERM OF OFFICE

    Each department consists of a maximum of 5 delegate seats and a regular term of office is 12 months. There is no limit to the number of terms a person can serve as department delegate, meaning a delegate can be elected and serve more than one term, consequently or not. 

### 3. REMOVAL PROCESS

    A delegate can be removed by a majority vote of his department, by a proposal from the community or by resigning of his own violation. A delegate's resignation may be offered verbally or in writing. If the delegate does not specify a resignation date, then the resignation takes effect when it is announced. A delegate saying “I quit!" during a department meeting – is enough to complete the resignation process.

    In case a member of a department resigns or is removed during their term of office, the department has the option of holding new elections to find a delegate to complete the missing member's term. However, the department is not obliged to do so as long as the department has three or more members.

    In the event that other candidates have also achieved the status “Passed” of their proposal in the previous election and have only not become part of the Department because the elected candidate has achieved a higher approval rating, the Department may also appoint the candidate with the next highest approval rating instead of holding new elections or keeping the seat empty.
