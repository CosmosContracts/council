# AMENDMENT G: CHARTER AMENDMENT PROCESS

## Charter Amendment Process

### 1. ORGANIZATION

    The Council will organize a Constitutional Convention ("Juno Con Con") every year to consider, work out, and propose amendments to the Charter as necessary. The Juno Con Con will commence every year (starting in 2025) in February, to ensure time to update the Charter before July, when the first year of the Charter in this revised version has been completed.
