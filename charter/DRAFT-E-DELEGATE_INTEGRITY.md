# AMENDMENT E: DELEGATE INTEGRITY

## Delegate Role Integrity

### 1. SEPARATION OF DELEGATES AND CONTRIBUTORS

    To guarantee an effective oversight of contributors, there is a need for a separation between the function of the delegates and the contributors. Department delegates must refrain from participating through Council or Department mandates and RFPs as a contractor or contributor if this position is subject to the supervision of their own department.

    In the event that a delegate participates in another department's RFP, the subsequent decision-making process must take place in the Council, where the Department of the participating delegate must abstain. If the other two Departments are unable to agree on a candidate, the decision-making process is escalated to the Juno community.

    This separation is to prevent mal-aligned or conflicts of interest in which a delegate is placed in a position where they must choose between their own self-interest or the interest of the Juno community. Separating the delegate and contributor roles as far as possible is to allow delegates to prioritize Juno's interests first.
