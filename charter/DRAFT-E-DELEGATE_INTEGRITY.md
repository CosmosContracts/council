# AMENDMENT E: DELEGATE INTEGRITY

## Delegate Role Integrity

### 1. SEPARATION OF DELEGATES AND CONTRIBUTORS

    To guarantee an effective oversight of contributors, there is a need for a separation between the function of the delegates and the contributors.
    
    Department delegates are permitted to participate in Council or Department RFPs as contractors or contributors. However, if they are selected, they must immediately step down from their delegate role.

    This separation is to prevent mal-aligned or conflicts of interest in which a delegate is placed in a position where they must choose between their own self-interest or the interest of the Juno community. Separating the delegate and contributor roles is to allow delegates to prioritize Juno's interests first.
