# AMENDMENT B: TERM OF OFFICE AND REMOVAL PROCESS

## Term of Office and Removal Process

### 1. TERM

    Each department consists of a maximum of 5 delegate seats and a regular term of office is 12 months. There is no limit to the number of terms a person can serve as department delegate, meaning a delegate can be elected and serve more than one term whether  consecutively or non consecutively.

### 2. REMOVAL

    A delegate can be removed by a majority vote of his department, by a proposal from the community or by resigning of his own volition.  If a delegate resigns of his own volition, he must do so by submitting a proposal to his department. The other department members must always comply with this request. However, the resigning delegate must still be available for at least two weeks in order to enable a proper handover of his or her previously performed duties. If he does not comply with that his outstanding compensation can be revoked.


    In case a member of a department resigns or is removed during their term of office, the department has the option of holding new elections to find a delegate to complete the missing member's term. However, the department is not obliged to do so as long as the department has three or more members.

    In the event that other candidates have also achieved the status “Passed” of their proposal in the previous election and have only not become part of the Department because the elected candidate has achieved a higher approval rating, the Department may also appoint the candidate with the next highest approval rating instead of holding new elections or keeping the seat empty.
    
    If there are no other candidates who achieved "Passed" status, and the department wishes to fill the position without holding general elections, they can propose a candidate to the community through a governance proposal. However, this can only be done once per term.
